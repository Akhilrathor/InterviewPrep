Sign up for an Apple Developer Program account if you haven't already.
Access App Store Connect, which is the platform used to manage your apps.

Create a new app record in App Store Connect.
Fill in the required metadata, including app name, description, keywords, screenshots, and app icon.

The distribution certificate is used to sign your app, ensuring that it comes from a verified developer.

Once the upload is complete, go back to App Store Connect.
Select your app and submit it for review. You may need to answer questions about your app's content and functionality.

##8. App Review Process:

Apple reviews your app to ensure it meets their guidelines and policies.
You may receive feedback or requests for changes during this process.
